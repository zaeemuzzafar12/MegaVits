            <p className="paragraph">Due to the impact of Covid-19, we have had slight delays in processing and shipping orders. We will contact you immediately if there are any issues with fulfilling orders in a timely manner. We have also temporarily disabled all international orders as nearly all shipments outside of the U.S. have been delayed or stuck during transit. This is due to the lack of international passenger flights from Covid.</p>
            <p className="paragraph">If you placed an order and have any questions, please contact us 352-394-8487 to get specific details regarding the status of your order. Thank you for your understanding - please be safe!</p>
